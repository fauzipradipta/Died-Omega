				As the new coronavirus is spreading, be cautious about all possible exposures, including at the gym or fitness center. The virus isnâ€™t spread through perspiration (sweat), but items touched by many people (barbells, etc.) could pose a risk. In order to practice social and physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is best to avoid public places at this time.
